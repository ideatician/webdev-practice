The idea for this app came about as a result of a discussion with my girlfriend on potential aides for impulse control.
She suggested I should complete a short questionnaire before engaging in a behavior I've deemed important to avoid in general.
These behaviors as of now include:
- Using alcohol, nicotine, or any other intoxicant
- Watching YouTube
My girlfriend originally suggested I do this on google forms, but I thought this would make a nice practice for constructing an app.

The idea is that behavior seems more out of control if one is not able to confront or justify what they are about to do beforehand.
The app shall be available both in Finnish and in English. 
The app is going to be scalable to different use cases that should still support the overall theme of mindful action.

"Aion" is the Finnish word for "I'm about to", "I'm going to", "I will", "I intend to".
Aion is also the name of a hellenistic deity associated with a cyclical notion of time. 
This is thematically fitting. Relapses and re-engagement follow each other in the procession (sic) of personal growth.

Core features of Aion:
- Username (email) and password login
- Premade templates for micro journalling when you're about to do something. My personal use case is the first of these.
- A template/questionnaire can be associated with a minimum word counter. A user can edit or remove this. My own use case and the default suggestion shall be 100 words to begin with.
- You cannot save a 'completed' or filled-in template if one's submission has fewer words than the template necessitates.
- Ability to edit and save such templates for one's own use.
- A user's completed confessions/pledges/resolutions are saved on the server for the user to access whenever.
- A user can easily share (or copy and paste) these to a loved one who is keeping them accountable (in my case this is my girlfriend).
- A user can seek to publish (anon or pen name) their own filled-in templates as a way to inspire others. They could also provide a description of the template and its use case.
  To begin with, I would manually approve these to be shown in the app in a section dedicated to them.
  If a template is good enough, I might consider adding them (with possible tweaks) to the core app, but users can also copy and save them for their own use from this section.

The first template:
1. (What is your) Current emotional state (?) / Tunnetila
2. Why am I doing this? / Miksi teen tämän?
3. What are the consequences? / Arvio teon seurauksista
4. Am I still going to do it? / Teenkö tämän oikeasti? (Binary choice question, no words)

The answers to the three first questions must be at least 100 words in total, but there is no minimum word count for any individual field.
The primary intention is to introduce a mindful delay between an impulse and acting upon it.
One can differentially focus on the questions in a way that feels most relevant at the time.
